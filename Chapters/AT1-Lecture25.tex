Reference: M. Groth - A short course on $\infty$-categories.

We will talk about quasi-categories, which are a model for \enquote{$\infty$-categories}/\enquote{$(\infty,1)$-categories} (whatever this means).

The philosophy is..?

This story began with Boardman and Vogt in '73, but then it remained dormient until Joyal (after the 2000) picked it up and eventually Lurie (Higher Topos Theory in '09).

A few more (non-precise) words about the philosophy of infinity categories.
\begin{itemize}
    \item An $\infty$-category has \tit{spaces} of morphisms (not sets), but we really only care about their weak homotopy types.
    
    \item Composition is no longer strictly defined, only \enquote{up to contractible choice}.
    
    \item \enquote{Equality} is meaningless, the role is taken up by \enquote{weak equivalences}
    
    \item Initial objects $I$ are now characterized by the property that for all objects $T$, $\map_\Cc(I,T)$ is weakly contractible.
\end{itemize}

For $0\le k\le n$, the $k$\tbf{-horn} $\Lambda^n_k$ is the simplicial subset of $\Delta^n$ generated by \[d_0,\dots,d_{k-1},d_{k+1},\dots,d_n.\]\alvaropls

For $0<k<n$, $Lambda^n_k$ is called an \tbf{inner horn}; $\Lambda^n_0$ and $Lambda^n_n$ are the \tbf{outer horns}.

A horn in a simplicial set $X$ is a morphism $\alpha:\Lambda^n_k\to X$; a horn has a filler if there is a morphism $\beta:\Delta^n\to X$ such that $\beta|_{\Lambda^n_k}=\alpha$.

%\[
%horn filler diagram

A simplicial set is a \tbf{Kan complex} if all horns have fillers. A simplicial set is a \tbf{quasi-category} if all inner horns have fillers.

There is a more concrete combinatorial reinterpretation of the Kan condition: given a morphism $\alpha:\Lambda^n_k\to X$, this is equivalent to the data $x_0=\alpha(d_0),\cdots,x_{k-1}=\alpha(d_{k-1}),*****$ which satisfy $d_i^*(x_j)=d_{j-1}^*(x_i)$ for all $0\le i<j\le n-1$ and $i,j\ne k$. Then a filler $\beta:\Delta^n\to X$ is equivalent to $y=\beta(\id_{[n]})$ which satisfies $d_i^*(y)=x_i$ for all $0\le i\le n$ and $i\ne k$.

\begin{example}
Let $C$ be a category. The nerve $NC$ of $C$ is a quasi category. A morphism $\alpha:\Lambda^2_1\to NC$ is just a pair of composable morphism $(x\xto{f}y\xto{g}z)=\beta\in (NC)_2$, then clearly the diagram
\[*****\]
shows that there is a filler.

For $n\ge3$, any horn contains the $1$-skeleton of $\Delta^n$. This means that fillers in $NC$ are unique, if they exist. The upshot is that in $NC$ all inner horns have unique fillers.

Then we can see that $NC$ is a Kan complex if and only if $C$ is a groupoid.

Note that later we will see that Kan complexes are the $\infty$-groupoids.
\end{example}

Quasi-categories \enquote{generalize} (contain as a full subcategory) the usual categories.

\begin{proposition}
The functor $N:\Cat\to qCat\subset\sSet$ is fully faithful with image those simplicial sets that have unique fillers for inner horns.
\end{proposition}

The proof is not too difficult, according to the Professor, we should be able to reconstruct it ourselves.

Some more terminology. If $\Cc$ is a quasi-category, the vertices $\Cc_0$ are the objects of $\Cc$, the edges $\Cc_1$ are the morphisms of $\Cc$:
\[d_1^*(f)=x\xto{f}y=d_0^*(f), s_0^*(x)=\id_x.\]
The $2$-simplices $\sigma\in\Cc_2$ are witnesses/homotopies for $d_1^*(\sigma)$ being a composition of $d_2^*(\sigma)$ and $d_0^*(\sigma)$
\[
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small]
& 1 \ar[dr,"g"] & \\
0 \ar[ur,"f"] \ar[rr,"h"] & & 2
\end{tikzcd}
\]
i.e. $\de\sigma=(d_0^*(0),d_1^*(\sigma),d_2^*(\sigma))$.

Let $K,L$ be simplicial sets. The mapping simplicial set $\map(K,L)$ is defined by
\[\map(K,L)_n=\Hom_\sSet(K\times\Delta^n,L)\]
where $\alpha^*:\map(K,L)_n\to\map(K,L)_m$ is
\[\alpha^*(f:K\times\Delta^n\to L):=f\circ(K\times\alpha_*).\]
There is a natural bijection of simplicial sets
\[\map(A,\map(K,L))\cong\map(A\times K,L).\]
If $L$ is a Kan complex, then the map
\begin{align*}
    |\map(K,L)|&\to\map(|K|,|L|)\\
    [f:K\times\Delta^n\to L,t\in\sx{n}]&\mapsto\cb{|K|\xto{(-,t)}|K|\times\sx{n}\cong|K\times\Delta^n|\xto{|f|}|L|}
\end{align*}
is a weak homotopy equivalence.

There is a non-trivial theorem.

\begin{theorem}[Joyal]
A simplicial set $X$ is a quasi-category if and only if the restriction morphism
\[\map(\Delta^2,X)\to\map(\Lambda^2_1,X)\]
is a Kan fibration and a weak equivalence.
\end{theorem}

Kan fibrations are the simplicial analogue of Serre fibrations, i.e. they have the relative lifting property for all horns
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
\Lambda^n_k \ar[d] \ar[r,"\alpha"] & X \ar[d]\\
\Delta^n \ar[r,"\Lambda"] & B
\end{tikzcd}
\]

There is something about the consequences of the theorem I did not understand here, see photos.

\subsection{The Homotopy Category of a Quasi-Category}

Let $\Cc$ be a quasi-category.

Let $f,g:x\to y$ be $\Cc$-morphisms. A homotopy from $f$ to $g$ is a $2$-simplex $\sigma\in\Cc_2$ such that
\[\de\sigma=(d_0^*(\sigma),d_1^*(\sigma),d_2^*(\sigma))=(g,f,\id_x=s_0^*(x)=s_0^*(d_1^*(f))=s_0^*(d_1^*(g)))\]\todo[color=red]{This is not the right definition! They are all equivalent anyway, but still...}

\[
see photos
\]

\begin{proposition}
Being homotopic is an equivalence relation on the set of $\Cc$-morphisms from $x$ to $y$. Moreover, $f$ is homotopic to $g$ if and only if there is a $\tau\in\Cc_2$ such that $\de\tau=(\id_y,g,f)$.

\[
see photos (previous board next to the other diagram!!!)
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Reflexivity. Missed it!!!

Symmetry. Let $\sigma$ be a homotopy from $f$ to $g$, i.e. $\de\sigma=(g,f,\id_x)$. Then
\[(\sigma,s_0^*(g),-,s_0^*(\id_x)):\Lambda^3_2\to\Cc\]
is an inner horn.
\[big diagram!!!\]
Let $\mu:\Delta^3\to\Cc$ be a filler. Then $d_2^*(\mu)$ is the desired homotopy:
\[\de(d_2^*(\mu))=(f,g,\id_x).\]

Transitivity. Let $\sigma$ be a homotopy from $f$ to $g$, $\tau$ a homotopy from $g$ to $h$.
\[(\tau,\sigma,-,s_0^*(\id_x)):\Lambda^3_2\to\Cc\]
is a inner horn.
\[big diagram!!!\]
Let $\mu:Delta^3\to\Cc$ be any filler. Then $\de(d_2^*(\mu))=(h,f,\id_x)$, so $d_2^*(\mu)$ is a homotopy from $f$ to $h$

Equivalence of the two versions of homotopy. Let $\sigma$ be a homotopy from $f$ to $g$
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
Let $f:x\to y$ and $g:y\to z$ be composable morphisms in $\Cc$. Choose $\sigma\in\Cc_2$ with $\de\sigma=(g,h,f)$. Then the homotopy class of $h$ is independent of the choice of $\sigma$ and only depends on the homotopy classes of $f$ and $g$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Partial]
Let $\tau\in\Cc_2$ be another choice of $2$-simplex with $\de\tau=(g,k,f)$. We need to show that $h$ and $k$ are homotopic. Fill the following $\Lambda^3_2$-horn.
\[bigdiagram!!!\]
